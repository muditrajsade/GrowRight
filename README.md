# ✅ GrowRight

GrowRight is a Flask-based web application that leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to recommend the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil parameters. This project empowers farmers, researchers, and agriculture enthusiasts with data-driven crop suggestions for optimal yield.

## 🌾 Overview

In the world of smart agriculture, selecting the right crop is crucial for optimizing land productivity. **GrowRight** uses machine learning to analyze environmental factors such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to predict the best crop to cultivate. The model is trained on the [Smart Agricultural Production Optimizing Engine dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chitrakumari25/smart-agricultural-production-optimizing-engine).

## 🚀 Core Features

- ✅ **Crop Recommendation**: Predicts the ideal crop based on user-input environmental data.
- 🧠 **Trained ANN Model**: Uses a TensorFlow-based artificial neural network with high accuracy.
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Simple and intuitive frontend built with HTML and CSS.
- 📊 **Data-Driven Insights**: Powered by real-world agricultural data.
- 🔁 **Real-Time Prediction**: Instantly processes inputs and returns the crop recommendation.
